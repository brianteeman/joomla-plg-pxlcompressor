PLG_PXLCOMPRESSOR="PXLCompressor"
PLG_PXLCOMPRESSOR_XML_DESCRIPTION="<h2>PXLCompressor</h2><p>This plugin automatically resizes the resolution of images which are uploaded through the Media Manager. This is often useful if images are not previously processed offline and uploaded in a too large resolution. The automatic resizing also reduces the size of the images, which can lead to serious performance improvements of the loading time. The plugin is executed directly when uploading images in the media manager and the 'Image' button in the edit mode.</p><h3>Use of compression services</h3><p>To use an external compression service, simply enable it by using checking a box or inserting an API key in the compression tab. If there is more than one service enabled others will be used as fallback."

PLG_PXLCOMPRESSOR_HEIGHT="Height"
PLG_PXLCOMPRESSOR_HEIGHT_DESC="Enter the height of the images here. This value can be left blank (fill in 0), then the value for width has to be set for the execution of the plugin.

PLG_PXLCOMPRESSOR_MULTISIZES="Specify Multi-Sizes"
PLG_PXLCOMPRESSOR_MULTISIZES_DESC="You can enter all sizes that you want to be created when uploading an image.

You have to enter the resolution (width and height) of the resized images. In fact, one integer value is sufficient which will be used for the width. The global values from the options 'Scale Method', 'JPG Quality' and 'PNG Compression' are used in the resizing process. The parameters are: width (integer) and height (integer). Enter one resolution each line, separate the parameters with a | (pipe symbol).<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />800|600<br />650|400<br />700|1000"

Resulting empty spaces are filled with black color.<br />SCALE FILL - Images are stretched to specified dimension. Attention: Image might get dissorted.
